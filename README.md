# CODSOFTtask3: To develop a model that can classify iris dataset.
# PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
Use the Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. 
# OBJECTIVE:
The Objective is to train a machine learning model from the sepal and petal measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species.
# LIBRARIES USED:

  1. numpy is used for a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays

  2. pandas is used easy manipulation, analysis, and cleaning of structured data.

  3. sklearn is useful for data mining and data analysis, including classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction

  4. matplotlib is useful for a wide range of plotting capabilities, from basic line plots to complex 3D plots

  5. seaborn is useful for high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics

# STEPS INVOLVED:

  1. Import Libraries and Load Dataset: Load the Iris dataset.
  
  2. Explore the Dataset: Understand the dataset structure.
     
  3. Data Visualization: Visualize the data to find patterns.

  4. Data Preprocessing: Split data into training and test sets, and standardize features.
  	
  5. Model Training: Train a KNN classifier.
  
  6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance.
    
  7. Experiment with decision tree Model: Try Decision tree classification algorithms to see if they perform better.
